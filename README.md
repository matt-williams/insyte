Crowd-sourced business insight for Intuit QuickBooks

Customer
Im X from TJC (The Jewellery Company) a highend luxury jewellery in London.
Iam trying to reduce the time used to make decision on buying the right inventory, as it takes over 6 hours to make a decision. Turn for the inventory takes longer than we estimated and we feel opportunities are lost on jewellery which aren't in stock.
But TJC doesnt have the insights to make decisions on buying the new stock.
Because we dont have enough time to investigate.
Which makes me feel sad we are losing out on opportunity & profit

In a perfect world we want the ordering to be automated whilst keeping up with the latest trend and demand.
The biggest benefit to me is saving time and being able to concentrate on selling our products.
Which makes me feel
Happy as our customers are able to enjoy their new jewellery.
